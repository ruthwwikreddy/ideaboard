## ❌ Why You're NOT Showing in Google Yet

### The Real Issue:

**Your website hasn't been discovered and indexed by Google yet.**

Even with perfect SEO, Google needs to:
1. **Discover** your website exists
2. **Crawl** your pages
3. **Index** your content
4. **Rank** you for relevant searches

This process normally takes **2-6 weeks or longer** for new websites.

### Additional Factors:

1. **Domain Age** - New domains start with zero authority
2. **No Backlinks** - Google hasn't found links to your site yet
3. **No Brand Signals** - Google doesn't recognize "IdeaBoard" as a brand yet
4. **Competition** - Many sites already rank for AI tool keywords
